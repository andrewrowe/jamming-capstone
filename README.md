# Jamming Capstone

Capstone project created to complete my Codecademy certification for building Front-End Web Applications.

The project was built using Javascript and the React.js framework. It allows a user to search the Spotify API for tracks, add them to
a temporary playlist, and then save the playlist to a user's Spotify Account for later use.
